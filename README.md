## **My process**

### Built with:

- Plain HTML and CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox

### **What I learned**

Since I've been working a lot with React and tools like Styled Components, I wanted to finish this challenge without any of them, so I used only plain HTML and CSS. It was good to remember some things about CSS variables, media queries without helpers and semantic HTML.

### **Continued development**

In the future, I want to try some CSS methodologies like BEM. That way, it can be more organised, although for this challenge I think it looks good.
